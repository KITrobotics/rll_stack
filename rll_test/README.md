## Test explanation

#### api\_testing.py: 
Only tests submissions for now.

   - test_tag_exists: 
   Submits a existing tag
   - test_tag_not_exists: 
   Submits a non existing tag
   - test_password_wrong: 
   Submits with wrong password
   - test_missing_arg_tag: 
   Submits a request without git\_tag
   - test_missing_arg_username: 
   Submits a request without username
   - test_double_submission: 
   Submits two jobs with same username right after another

#### worker\_testing.py: 
Tests builds of worker

  - test_build_success: 
  Run a successfull build (running container, cloning, building): Check build.log if "[build] Summary: All (n) packages succeeded!" is found. No further status checks.
   - test_build_fail: 
   Run a test where build fails (running container, cloning, building fails): Check job_status = "finished" and job_result = "building project failed". Failure is forced by missing character in package.xml
   - test_job_success: 
   Run a test with a job that finishes(running container, cloning, building,executing): Check for success simply by check job_status: status = success. Additionally checks if log folder exists
   - test_storage_fail: Run a test and write a 11GB file to disk : Check if keyword "MemoryError" occurs in launch log
   - test_infinity_loop: 
   Just run a while loop forever, after certain timeout (by now 303 seconds) job_status is checkd for finished and job_result for "execution timeout". By now checking of build logs fails, needs to be investigated
  - test\_available\_topics\_params\_services: 
  Contains a black and whitelist for services, params and topics. These need to be defined in order to check for topics/params/services that must be available and topics/params/services that must not be enabled. By now, whitelist and blacklist are empty and need to be defined **tbd**
  - test\_check\_internet\_connection:
  Checks for internet connection by trying to reach server from google.com 
  - test\_cpu\_load:
  Generates cpu load for the time specified in the project. By now 300 seconds of 100% load on all available cores.
  
## How to run tests

### Prerequisites:

The job collection in the test database needs to be empty.

## Test preparations

Launch the simulation environment:

       `roslaunch rll_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch`

Start the server in a new terminal:

      `roslaunch rll_server server.launch`

Then start the worker for the test projects in an additional terminal:

     `roslaunch rll_worker worker.launch project:=test_projects`

Run tests using `rostest`:

    `rostest rll_test test_api.launch` runs only api tests
    `rostest rll_test test_worker.launch` runs only worker tests   
    `rostest rll_test test_all.launch`   runs all tests


## Evaluate tests

During execution you see the overview of the test results, something like:

    `[ROSUNIT] Outputting test results to /home/wirth/.ros/test_results/rll/rosunit-Test_submission.xml
    `[Testcase: test_password_wrong] ... ok
    `[Testcase: test_tag_exists] ... ok
    `[Testcase: test_tag_not_exists] ... ok
    `-------------------------------------------------------------
    `SUMMARY:
    ` * RESULT: SUCCESS
    ` * TESTS: 3
    ` * ERRORS: 0 []
    ` * FAILURES: 0 []   

As you can see, results are also written in the file which is mentioned in the output. There you can see further information like the output of the print statements.

If you want all output in the terminal instead of the XML file, run `rostest` with the `-t` option.
